Project Overview
This project aims to predict the quality of wine based on various chemical properties using machine learning algorithms. The wine quality dataset includes a range of input variables, making it a suitable fit for data science applications. By analyzing the data, we can determine the critical factors affecting wine quality, which can be used to improve the winemaking process.

Justification for Data Science Application
The wine quality dataset is an excellent fit for data science applications because it involves a variety of input variables that can be used to predict wine quality. This is important for wine producers, distributors, and consumers. Data analysis can help identify critical factors affecting wine quality, thereby improving the winemaking process.

Data
The dataset used in this project is the Wine Quality Dataset. It contains the following columns:

fixed acidity
volatile acidity
citric acid
residual sugar
chlorides
free sulfur dioxide
total sulfur dioxide
density
pH
sulphates
alcohol
quality
Pre-processing
Load the dataset.
Inspect the first few rows of the dataset.
Check the shape and descriptive statistics of the dataset.
Ensure there are no missing values.
